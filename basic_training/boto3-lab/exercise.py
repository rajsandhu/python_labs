# this basically a googling exercise for specific documentation

# ----- for me maybe since I haven't done the terraform stuff yet ----
# Write a boto3 script that prints out all EC2 instances
# in your lab account.
# Then for each instance found, attach a new AWS tag


# --- for rest of class ---
# Write a boto3 script that prints out all VPCs and Subnets
# in your lab account.
# Then for each resource found (VPC and subnets), attach a new AWS tag
# Project: Talent-Academy" where tag key is "Project" and tag value is
# "Talent-Academy"

# but it does look like I have VPC stuff running in the Frankfurt
